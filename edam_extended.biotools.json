In such cases, an index tag (or \"barcode\") - a unique sequence of between 6 and 12bp - is ligated to each sample's genetic material so that the sequence reads from different samples can be identified. The process of demultiplexing (dividing sequence reads into separate files for each index tag/sample) may be performed automatically by the sequencing hardware. Alternatively the reads may be lumped together in one file with barcodes still attached, requiring you to do the splitting using software. In such cases, a \"mapping\" file is used which indicates which barcodes correspond to which samples."

Haplotype comparison is a useful way to characterize the genetic variation between individuals.

Tools might use combinatorial functions (for example parsimony) or a likelihood function or model with optimisation such as minimum error correction (MEC) model, expectation-maximisation algorithm (EM), genetic algorithm or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)."

XTC files use a reduced precision (lossy) algorithm which works multiplying the coordinates by a scaling factor (typically 1000), so converting them to pm (GROMACS standard distance unit is nm). This allows an integer rounding of the values. Several other tricks are performed, such as making use of atom proximity information: atoms close in sequence are usually close in space (e.g. water molecules). That makes XTC format the most efficient in terms of disk usage, in most cases reducing by a factor of 2 the size of any other binary trajectory format."

In the compression/decompression process, part of the original information is lost, depending on the final number of eigenvectors chosen. However, with a reasonable choice of the set of eigenvectors the compression typically reduces the trajectory file to less than one tenth of their original size with very acceptable loss of information. Compression with PCAZip can only be applied to unsolvated structures."

XTC files use a reduced precision (lossy) algorithm which works multiplying the coordinates by a scaling factor (typically 1000), so converting them to pm (GROMACS standard distance unit is nm). This allows an integer rounding of the values. Several other tricks are performed, such as making use of atom proximity information: atoms close in sequence are usually close in space (e.g. water molecules). That makes XTC format the most efficient in terms of disk usage, in most cases reducing by a factor of 2 the size of any other binary trajectory format."
